# Kanban Board Application

Welcome to the **Kanban Board Application**! This project is a highly flexible and customizable board designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Each user has their own Kanban board, allowing them to create, organize, and modify tasks and columns as per their needs.

## Features

- **User-Specific Boards**: Each user gets a personalized Kanban board after signing up, providing a unique workspace to manage tasks.
- **Third-Party Authentication**: Sign up and log in with **GitHub** or **Google** accounts for seamless access.
- **Highly Customizable Columns**: Users can create, rename, move, and delete columns to better organize their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Add new tasks, edit task details, assign priorities, and delete tasks. Tasks can also be moved between columns easily using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal usability across different devices.
- **Network Status Check**: The application keeps track of the user's network status to ensure all actions are properly handled in case of disconnection.
